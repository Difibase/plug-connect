# Plug Connnect

The Plug Connect button is a basic React Component button you can use to integrate Plug's Agent features for authenticating a user's identity and requesting access to the Plug Agent to sign requests to your canisters on behalf of that identity.

## ü§î Installation

The [Plug Connect](https://github.com/Psychedelic/plug-connect/packages/919824) package is in the [Github Package Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry) and not in the [NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/)!

This is important to note as we keep our projects under the [@Psychedelic organisation](https://github.com/psychedelic) on Github, our official channel for our projects.

```
yarn add @psychedelic/plug-connect
```

To pull and install the Plug Connect package from [@Psychedelic](https://github.com/psychedelic) via the NPM CLI, you'll need:

- A personal access token (you can create a personal acess token [here]((https://github.com/settings/tokens)))
- The personal access token with the correct scopes, **repo** and **read:packages** to be granted access to the [GitHub Package Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages).

- Authentication via `npm login`, using your Github email for the **username** and the **personal access token** as your **password**:

Once you have those ready, run:

```
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@Psychedelic
```

!!! Note
    
    You only need to configure this once to install the package!
    On npm login provide your Github email as your username and the Personal access token as the password.

## üéÅ Use

Import the PlugConnect package:

```js
import PlugConnect from '@psychedelic/plug-connect';
```

Use the component:

```js
<PlugConnect
  onConnectCallback={() => console.log("Some callback")}
/>
```

The props `dark` and `title` are also supported:

```js
<PlugConnect
  dark
  onConnectCallback={() => console.log("Some callback")}
  title="My title"
/>
```

## ‚ö° Development

You'll need to have `nodejs` installed, NPM or [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/) which is the preferred package manager throught this document, feel free to use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) by changing the commands in accordance.

Pull the repository to your local and install the dependencies by:

```zsh
yarn install
```

To start the development server:

```sh
yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

## üìö Storybook

Then Storybook:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This loads the stories from `./stories`.
